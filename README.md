# 🎓𝗗𝗦𝗣: Demonstrate–Search–Predict

A framework for composing retrieval models and language models into powerful pipelines that tackle knowledge-intensive tasks.

[ArXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14024.pdf)

## Installation

```pip install .```

## 🏃 Getting Started

Our [intro notebook](intro.ipynb) provides examples of five "multi-hop" question answering programs of increasing complexity written in DSP.

Once you go through the notebook, you'll be ready to create your own DSP pipelines!
